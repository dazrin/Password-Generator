## About
This is a random password generator application made using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
This application uses lowercase, uppercase, numbers and symbols to randomly generate a password from 8 to 128 characters depending on the user's input.
  You can launch the application by clicking [here.](https://dazrin.github.io/Password-Generator/) 
  Website URL: https://dazrin.github.io/Password-Generator/
  
## Instructions
When clicking the 'Generate Password' button, you will be greeted with a series of prompts to allow you to decide how long your password will be, as well as the types of characters that will be included.
1. The first prompt will ask the user how many characters the password will have.
> You must only enter a number between 8 and 128; otherwise you will not be able to continue.
2. The second prompt will ask the user if they would like to include lowercase characters in the password.
  Click 'OK' to include them, and 'Cancel' to exclude them.
3. The third prompt will ask the user if they would like to include uppercase characters in the password.
  Click 'OK' to include them, and 'Cancel' to exclude them.
4. The fourth prompt will ask the user if they would like to include numbers in the password.
  Click 'OK' to include them, and 'Cancel' to exclude them.
5. The fifth prompt will ask the user if they would like to include special characters in the password.
  Click 'OK' to include them, and 'Cancel' to exclude them.
 > The special characters that the application will choose from are here: !@#$%^&*()-_=+{[]}|;:',<.>/?`~
6. Additionally, once the password has been generated with the criteria of your choice, this application features a button that allows you to copy the generated password to the clipboard.
 > Simply click the 'Copy to Clipboard' button and you will be able to paste your newly generated password.

Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
